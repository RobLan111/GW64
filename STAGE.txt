This set of files contains several documents:

A directory WEBSERVERSD12

A file WEBSERVER12.ino. 
This is an Arduino file.
It sits in the directory WEBSERVERSD12
It is a slightly modified testprogram for checking out Ethernet and SD
This is designed for an Arduino Uno or Mega equipped with a Ethernet/SD shield
The file calls up a html file called STAGE.html
The purpose is to check the UIF functionality when loaded from Arduino\
When pointed to the IP address of the Arduino on which this program is loaded
the UIF should show up.
When the 4th button is pressed, the LED13 should go on for a second



A file STAGE.htm
This must be present on the SD card
This is a renamed copy of the 'current' Stage_4_3 *.htm file
As the SD only can handle 8.3 type files, the original .html file name needs to be shortened
Currently it is a copy of the file Stage_4_3_RLV18Editra.htm.
which is a reworked version of stage_4_3.htm made by GW  
Notably it calles jquery-3.2.1.js which needs to sit on the SD


jquery-3.2.1.js
The jquery library file which should reside on the SD.
When the buttons in the UIF donot have the normally 
expacted spacing or color, try to load this file from internet

Test2.php
A test file to be placed  in a non arduino environment into the same directory as STAGE.htm


Stage_4_3_RLV18Editra.htm
The stage file as modified by RL to compress the code a little as test

STAGE.txt
